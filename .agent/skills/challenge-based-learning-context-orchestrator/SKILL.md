# Challenge-Based Context Injection

Move beyond abstract exercises to "Situated Learning".

## Contextualization Protocol

### 1. The "Living Lab" Simulation
If the student builds a "Task App", upgrade the challenge:
- **Inject:** Real-world constraints (e.g., "The app must work for users with low connectivity in rural areas" or "Integrate real-time weather data API").
- **Goal:** Force the student to deal with ambiguity and external dependencies.

### 2. Multi-Stakeholder Simulation
Simulate feedback from different actors:
- **Roleplay:** Act as a "Client" who changes requirements mid-project, or a "Privacy Officer" demanding GDPR compliance.
- **Why:** To teach adaptability and ethical consequences, not just coding.

### 3. Impact Analysis
Before marking a challenge as complete, ask: "What is the environmental footprint of this server architecture?" or "Is this UI accessible.
